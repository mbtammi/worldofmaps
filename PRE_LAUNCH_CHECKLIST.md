## 🧪 Pre-Launch Testing Checklist

### Critical Functionality
- [ ] **Daily Challenge Rotation**
  - [ ] Test at reset time (7am Finland time / 5am UTC)
  - [ ] Verify different datasets appear each day
  - [ ] Confirm progress saves/loads correctly
  - [ ] Check "already played" modal shows after completion

- [ ] **Options Randomization**
  - [ ] Verify 10 different options each day
  - [ ] Confirm same options for all users on same day
  - [ ] Test that correct answer is included
  - [ ] Check no duplicate options appear

- [ ] **Game Flow**
  - [ ] Make correct guess → see win state
  - [ ] Make 3 wrong guesses → see lose state
  - [ ] Verify hints unlock progressively
  - [ ] Check fun fact appears at end
  - [ ] Test statistics update correctly

### Cross-Device Testing
- [ ] **Mobile (iOS Safari)**
  - [ ] Drawer slide-up interaction smooth

### Security & Privacy
- [ ] **Production Build**
  - [ ] Run `npm run build` and check bundle size

  - [ ] Open browser console - verify NO revealing logs
  - [ ] Check that answers are not exposed in network tab
  - [ ] Verify source maps are not generated

- [ ] **Data Integrity**
  - [ ] Dataset options don't reveal answer pattern
  - [ ] No hardcoded answers in client code
  - [ ] Cache keys don't expose sensitive data

### Performance
- [ ] **Load Time**

  ```bash
  npm run build
  # Check dist/ folder size
  # Target: < 500KB initial bundle
  ```

- [ ] **Lighthouse Score**
  - [ ] Performance > 90
  - [ ] Accessibility > 90
  - [ ] Best Practices > 90
  - [ ] SEO > 90

### User Experience
- [ ] **Visual Polish**

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Offline behavior (should show error with retry)
- [ ] Slow network (loading state shown)
- [ ] Data fetch failure (fallback to cached/static data)
- [ ] LocalStorage full (graceful degradation)
- [ ] Browser back/forward navigation
- [ ] Page refresh mid-game (progress restored)

## 🚢 Deployment Steps

### 1. Final Code Review
```bash
# Check for any remaining console.log
grep -r "console\.log" src/ | grep -v "node_modules" | grep -v ".js.map"

# Verify no TODO comments remain
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME" src/ | grep -v "node_modules"
```

### 2. Build & Test
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run production build
npm run build

# Test production build locally
npm run preview
# Visit http://localhost:4173
```

### 3. Pre-Deploy Commit
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "🚀 Pre-launch: Fixes for options randomization, security, and performance

- Implemented seeded randomization for daily options (30-item pool)
- Secured console logs with environment-aware logger
- Added lazy loading for ShareSheet component
- Optimized Vite build config for production
- Added error handling and retry functionality
- Performance improvements: code splitting, memoization

Ready for Friday launch! 🎉"

git push origin main
```

### 4. Deploy to Vercel
```bash
# Vercel will automatically deploy on push to main
# Or manually trigger:
vercel --prod
```

### 5. Post-Deploy Verification
- [ ] Visit production URL
- [ ] Test game flow end-to-end
- [ ] Check console for errors (should only see errors/warnings, no spoilers)
- [ ] Test on mobile device
- [ ] Verify share functionality
- [ ] Check analytics are tracking

---

## 📊 Monitoring After Launch

### Immediate (First 24 Hours)
- [ ] Monitor Vercel analytics for errors
- [ ] Check completion rates
- [ ] Watch for any crash reports
- [ ] Monitor server costs/API usage
- [ ] Respond to early user feedback

### First Week
- [ ] Track daily active users
- [ ] Monitor share click-through rates
- [ ] Check retention (users returning next day)
- [ ] Gather feedback on difficulty
- [ ] Identify any dataset issues

### Metrics to Track
- Daily active users (DAU)
- Completion rate (% who finish game)
- Average guesses to win
- Share rate (% who share results)
- Retention (% returning next day)
- Error rate (% encountering errors)

---

## 🎯 Known Limitations (Future Improvements)

### Nice to Have (Post-Launch)
- [ ] Add service worker for offline play
- [ ] Implement streak tracking
- [ ] Add more dataset categories
- [ ] Create admin dashboard for dataset management
- [ ] Add accessibility improvements (keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Implement A/B testing framework
- [ ] Add user accounts (optional)
- [ ] Create mobile app versions

### Data Quality
- [ ] Some datasets may have incomplete country coverage (< 60 countries)
- [ ] Fallback datasets kick in when primary fails
- [ ] World Bank API can be slow (30-day cache mitigates this)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### "Unable to load today's challenge"
- **Cause**: Data fetch failed from all sources
- **Fix**: User can click "Retry" button
- **Long-term**: Add more fallback datasets

### Options look the same every day
- **Cause**: dayIndex not being passed correctly
- **Check**: Inspect localStorage for cached datasets
- **Fix**: Clear cache and reload

### Share button doesn't work
- **Cause**: Web Share API not supported (desktop browsers)
- **Expected**: ShareSheet modal should open instead
- **Check**: Verify ShareSheet loads correctly

### Globe not rendering
- **Cause**: WebGL not supported or GPU issues
- **Check**: Browser console for three.js errors
- **Fallback**: Consider adding 2D map fallback
