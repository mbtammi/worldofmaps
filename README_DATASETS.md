# 🎉 Dataset Expansion Complete - Ready for Launch!

## Summary

**Problem Solved:** You now have **58 unique datasets** instead of 12!

### What You Get

✅ **58 datasets** rotating daily (56 World Bank + 2 OWID)  
✅ **58-day guarantee** - No duplicates for nearly 2 months!  
✅ **Complete tracking** - Always know which dataset was shown on any date  
✅ **Educational variety** - 8 different categories spanning demographics, economy, health, environment, tech, infrastructure, education, and culture

## How to Use

### View the Schedule

```bash
# Next 7 days
npm run schedule

# Past 7 days  
npm run schedule:past

# Next 30 days
npm run schedule:month

# Custom: next 90 days
npm run schedule 90

# Custom: past 14 days
npm run schedule -- -14
```

### Verify Everything Works

```bash
npm run verify:rotation
```

This will show:
- Total available datasets: 58
- Current cycle position
- No duplicate verification
- Coverage analysis

### Check What Dataset Was Used on a Specific Date

**Option 1: Use the schedule viewer**
```bash
node scripts/view-dataset-schedule.js -30  # See last 30 days
```

**Option 2: In browser console (for debugging)**
```javascript
import { getDatasetHistory, getCurrentDayIndex } from './src/data/dailyChallenge.js'

const today = getCurrentDayIndex()
const history = getDatasetHistory(today - 30, today)
console.table(history.history)
```

## Dataset Categories (58 Total)

| Category | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| 💰 Economy & Development | 14 | GDP, unemployment, trade, manufacturing |
| 👥 Demographics & Society | 13 | Population, life expectancy, birth rates |
| 🏥 Health & Wellbeing | 8 | Healthcare, hospitals, immunization |
| 🌍 Environment & Climate | 7 | Forest, energy, emissions |
| 🚧 Infrastructure & Transport | 6 | Water, electricity, roads, railways |
| 💻 Technology & Innovation | 4 | Internet, mobile, broadband |
| 🎓 Education & Knowledge | 4 | Literacy, enrollment, education spending |
| 🎭 Culture & Lifestyle | 2 | Coffee, alcohol consumption |

## How the Rotation Works

1. **Cycle-based**: Every 58 days = one complete cycle
2. **Seeded shuffle**: Each cycle gets a different random order
3. **No duplicates**: Within each 58-day period, every dataset appears exactly once
4. **Deterministic**: Same day = same dataset for all users worldwide
5. **Trackable**: You can always look up historical datasets

### Example
- **Day 0-57**: All 58 datasets appear once (shuffled order)
- **Day 58-115**: All 58 datasets appear again (different shuffle)
- **Day 116-173**: New cycle with new shuffle
- And so on...

## Important Files Changed

1. **`src/data/dataSources.js`**
   - Expanded `highAvailability` array from 8 to 56 datasets
   - All World Bank indicators now enabled

2. **`src/data/dailyChallenge.js`**
   - Added `seededShuffle()` function
   - Updated `getDatasetForDay()` with cycle-based rotation
   - Added `getDatasetHistory()` function
   - Added `getRotationStats()` function

3. **`scripts/view-dataset-schedule.js`** (NEW)
   - View past/future dataset schedule
   - Shows category icons and dates

4. **`scripts/verify-rotation.js`** (NEW)
   - Verifies system integrity
   - Checks for duplicates

5. **`package.json`**
   - Added npm scripts for easy access

## Ready for Friday Launch? ✅

- ✅ 58 datasets enabled (up from 12)
- ✅ No duplicates for 58 days
- ✅ Fully trackable history
- ✅ Educational variety maximized
- ✅ All console logs still secure (no answers revealed)
- ✅ Performance optimizations intact
- ✅ Documentation complete

## Future: Adding More Datasets

When you add datasets from other APIs:

1. **Add API indicators** to `WORLD_BANK_INDICATORS` or `OWID_DATASETS`
2. **Update availability** in `getDatasetAvailability()` function
3. **That's it!** The rotation system automatically adjusts

The pool size will grow (e.g., 100 datasets = 100 unique days), but no algorithm changes needed.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Development
npm run dev                # Start dev server
npm run build             # Build for production
npm run preview           # Preview production build

# Dataset Management
npm run schedule          # View next 7 days
npm run schedule:past     # View past 7 days
npm run schedule:month    # View next 30 days
npm run verify:rotation   # Test system integrity

# Verification
node scripts/view-dataset-schedule.js [days]
node scripts/verify-rotation.js
```
